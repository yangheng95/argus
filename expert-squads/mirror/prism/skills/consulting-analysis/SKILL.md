# Analysis Framework Generation

## Purpose

Given a **research subject** (e.g., "Gen-Z Skincare Market", "NEV Industry Competitive Landscape", "Brand X Consumer Profiling"), produce a complete **analysis framework** that serves as the blueprint for structured analytical work and data collection.

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Research Subject** | The topic or question to be analyzed | Yes |
| **Scope / Constraints** | Geographic scope, time range, industry segment, target audience, etc. | Optional |
| **Specific Angles** | Any particular angles or hypotheses the user wants explored | Optional |
| **Domain** | The analytical domain: market, finance, industry, brand, consumer, investment, etc. | Inferred |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Research Subject

- Parse the research subject to identify the **core entity** (market, brand, product, industry, consumer segment, financial instrument, etc.)
- Identify the **analytical domain** (marketing, finance, industry, competitive, consumer, investment, macro, etc.)
- Determine the **natural analytical dimensions** based on domain:

| Domain | Typical Dimensions |
|--------|--------------------|
| Market Analysis | Market size, growth trends, market segmentation, growth drivers, competitive landscape, consumer profiling |
| Brand Analysis | Brand positioning, market share, consumer perception, marketing strategy, competitor comparison |
| Consumer Insights | Demographic profiling, purchase behavior, decision journey, pain points, scenario analysis |
| Financial Analysis | Macro environment, industry trends, company fundamentals, financial metrics, valuation, risk assessment |
| Industry Research | Value chain analysis, market size, competitive landscape, policy environment, technology trends, entry barriers |
| Investment Due Diligence | Business model, financial health, management assessment, market opportunity, risk factors, exit pathways |
| Competitive Intelligence | Competitor identification, strategic comparison, SWOT analysis, differentiated positioning, market dynamics |

### Step 2: Select Analysis Frameworks & Models

#### Industry & Supply Chain Analysis

| Framework | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Industry Value Chain** | Upstream → Midstream → Downstream decomposition | Industry structure understanding, profit distribution analysis |
| **Gartner Hype Cycle** | Technology Trigger → Peak of Inflated Expectations → Trough of Disillusionment → Slope of Enlightenment → Plateau of Productivity | Emerging technology maturity assessment |
| **GE-McKinsey Matrix** | Industry Attractiveness × Competitive Strength | Business portfolio prioritization, investment decisions |

#### Selection Principles

1. **Domain-First**: Based on the domain identified in Step 1, select **2-4** most relevant frameworks from the toolkit above
2. **Complementary**: Choose complementary rather than overlapping frameworks (e.g., macro-level with PESTEL + micro-level with Porter's Five Forces)
3. **Depth over Breadth**: Better to deeply apply 2 frameworks than superficially stack 6
4. **Data-Feasible**: Selected frameworks must be supportable by data collection — if the data required cannot be reasonably obtained, downgrade or substitute
5. **Explicit Mapping**: In the analysis plan, explicitly annotate which framework each analytical module uses and how it is applied

#### Framework Selection Output Format

```markdown
## Framework Selection

| Analytical Module | Selected Framework(s) | Application |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Market Size & Growth Trends | TAM-SAM-SOM + Product Life Cycle | TAM-SAM-SOM to quantify market space, PLC to determine market stage |
| Competitive Landscape Assessment | Porter's Five Forces + Strategic Group Mapping | Five Forces to assess industry competition intensity, Group Mapping to visualize competitive positioning |
| Consumer Profiling | RFM + Consumer Decision Journey | RFM to segment customer value, Decision Journey to identify key conversion nodes |
| Strategic Assessment | SWOT + Blue Ocean Strategy | SWOT to summarize overall landscape, Blue Ocean to guide differentiation direction |
```

### Step 3: Define Analytical Modules

Structure the analysis into logical modules. Each module must include:

1. **Module Title** — Professional, concise, describing the analytical focus
2. **Analysis Objective** — What this module aims to reveal or answer
3. **Analysis Logic** — The reasoning chain or framework applied (must reference the frameworks selected in Step 2)
4. **Core Hypothesis** — Preliminary hypotheses to be validated or refuted by data

#### Analytical Modules Output Format

```markdown
## Analysis Structure

### Module 1: [Title]
- **Analysis Objective**: [What this module aims to reveal]
- **Analysis Logic**: [Framework or reasoning chain used]
- **Core Hypothesis**: [Hypotheses to validate]
- **Data Requirements**: (see Step 4)
- **Visualization Plan**: (see Step 5)

### Module 2: [Title]
...
```

### Step 4: Define Data Requirements Per Module

For each module, specify **exactly what data needs to be collected**. This guides downstream data collection work.

Each data requirement entry must include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Data Metric** | The specific metric or data point needed (e.g., "China skincare market size 2020-2025 (in billion CNY)") |
| **Data Type** | Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed |
| **Suggested Sources** | Suggested source categories: Industry reports, financial statements, government statistics, social media, e-commerce platforms, survey data, news |
| **Search Keywords** | Suggested search queries for data collection |
| **Priority** | P0 (Required) / P1 (Important) / P2 (Supplementary) |
| **Time Range** | The time period the data should cover |

#### Data Requirements Output Format (per module)

```markdown
#### Data Requirements

| # | Data Metric | Data Type | Suggested Sources | Search Keywords | Priority | Time Range |
|---|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Market size (billion CNY) | Quantitative | Industry reports, government statistics | "China skincare market size 2024" | P0 | 2020-2025 |
| 2 | CAGR | Quantitative | Industry reports | "skincare CAGR growth rate" | P0 | 2020-2025 |
| 3 | Sub-category share | Quantitative | E-commerce platforms, industry reports | "skincare category share cream serum sunscreen" | P1 | Latest |
| 4 | Policy & regulatory updates | Qualitative | Government announcements, news | "cosmetics regulation 2024" | P2 | Past 1 year |
```

### Step 5: Define Visualization Plan Per Module

For each module, specify the **planned visualization** to support analytical findings:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Visualization Type** | Chart type: Line chart, bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, radar chart, heatmap, Sankey diagram, comparison table, etc. |
| **Visualization Title** | Descriptive title for the chart |
| **Visualization Data Mapping** | Which data indicators map to X/Y axes or segments |
| **Comparison Table Design** | Column headers and comparison dimensions for data contrast |
